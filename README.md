## mongo-ex-hbs

Small example of MongoDB working with node and handlebars

## Setup

Use npm install to add dependencies. You'll still need to install mongodb and add a collection named example.

## Working progress

Still needs a lot of work. Needs to add a method to delete, modify and create new tasks.
